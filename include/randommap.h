/*
 * This function is to gennerate a random map by coherent noise module.
 *
 * To directly use the 2D coherent noise map will not give a sensable map, so
 *  we use the sum of noise maps in different frequencies. The low-freq map
 *  provides the macro terrain with a large coefficient, and the high-freq map
 *  provides the micro roughness with a small coeffcient.
 * The octave controls how many components contributes to the final map, and 
 *  the highest freq is 2 to the octave-th power times of the lowest freq. With
 *  the freq's increasing, the coefficient decreases exponentially.
